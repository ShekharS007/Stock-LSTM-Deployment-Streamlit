# Stock Market Analysis & Prediction App ðŸ“ˆ

## Overview

Welcome to the **Stock Market Analysis & Prediction App**, a tool built with **Streamlit** that leverages historical stock data to predict future prices using a trained **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** model. This project was created for learning purposes, and while it provides insights into stock trends, it is not intended for financial decision-making. 

### Key Features:
- Fetches live historical stock data from **Yahoo Finance**.
- Visualizes stock trends (volume, closing prices, intraday price movements).
- Predicts the next trading day's stock price using an **RNN-LSTM** model.
- Supports both international and Indian stock markets (e.g., `RELIANCE.NS`, `AAPL`).
- Skips predictions for weekends and non-trading days.

## How to Use the App
1. **Input Stock Ticker**: Enter the stock symbol (e.g., `MSFT`, `RELIANCE.NS`).
2. **Select Date Range**: Choose the starting and ending dates for the analysis.
3. **Analyze Trends**:
   - View stock data, including volume, high/low prices, and average closing prices.
   - Explore intraday price movements with interactive visualizations.
4. **Predict Future Prices**:
   - View predicted prices for the next trading day (based on historical data).

## Limitations
- The model predictions are based on historical trends and may not accurately represent future performance.
- Limited by computational power and scope of training data.
- Predictions are not generated for weekends or non-trading days.
